<h3>JQuery Form Elements</h3>

<p>
These are two demonstrations of manipulating form input components with JQuery. You can
enter the number of the select box and then press the button. Note that the select box
takes multiple selections, and JQuery will clear the selections and select the item that
you entered.
</p>
<p>
The radio button demonstration shows how to limit selections across groups.
