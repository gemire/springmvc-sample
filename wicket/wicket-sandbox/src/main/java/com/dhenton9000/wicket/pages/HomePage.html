                This content is from the HomePage.html in com.dhenton900.wicket
                HomePage.java which derives from TemplatePage.java. The
                TemplatePage.html uses its wicket:child tag to look
                for the extend tag here (in homepage html)
                and replace the content of that
                child tag with this extend tag content.
            </p>
            <p>TemplatePage.html is the layout to which markup is 
                'substituted' by the classes that inherit from its corresponding
                java class. The wicket:child tag has to be here (in template.html), and
                the html files for the child must have a wicket:extend
                tag for substitution to take place

        </wicket:extend>
