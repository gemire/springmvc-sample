<h3>Angular Restaurant Application</h3>


<div>
	<p>This demonstration illustrates using <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular</a>
	for a client side editing application.</p>
	<p>One noticeable difference in this application is that the communication
	between the regions of the code, list, edit and review areas, is via a message bus,
	rather than $scope.watch or emit or broadcast. This way, components do not have
	to be tied to the DOM hierarchy to allow for scope communication.
