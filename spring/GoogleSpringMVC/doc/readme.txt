This is the source for donhenton.appspot.com. It is an eclipse project and uses
the eclipse plugin for the GAE. It contains the jar files needed to compile 
and cannot use maven. It has been adjusted to eliminate the image generating application.

The pom file in this folder is an example for other projects, but cannot be used
here. Further development will have to be in eclipse
