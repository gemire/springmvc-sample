<h3>Processing Input via Message Converters</h3>
<div>
This is a demonstration of processing input via message converters. These actions
will get various forms of data from the server and use jquery to convert them.
This also shows that a given function can be used to produce output in either json
or xml, depending on the call.
This is accomplished using the ContentNegotiatingViewResolver in the spring-servlet.xml
file
