Be sure in your web file to mark the ejbbeans jar as "PROVIDED" if it shows up in WEB-INF/lib
it will cause a class cast exception when using the JNDI lookup

see http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ClassLoadingOverview there should only be one copy of the
jar file and that is provided by the ear pom
