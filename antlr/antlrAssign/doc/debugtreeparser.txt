Use antlrworks and the menu option RUN --> DEBUG to create a debug version 
of the tree grammar file.

The normal treegrammar code generation is thru the GENERATE menu option

See the command line folder for command line code generation
The debug option for tree grammars doesn't seem to work 
The debug option works for parsers however

Run the test rig and it will block inside the tree grammar when the tree
grammar is a debug grammar. Attach via ANTLRWORKS using the tree grammar file.
