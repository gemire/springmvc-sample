this is a library for processing xmlstreamreaders to strings
it seems that if you ask for validation=true, you never get payload=body
to return a String, so you will have to use something like this

if you look at the test-mule-client-proxy-validate, you will see that 
adding 'validationEnabled="true"' in the cxf:proxy-service
produces a stream that doesn't allow for getting a string,
 but test-mule-client-proxy-novalidate will produce a stream that can be 
read as a string using getpayloadasstring.
