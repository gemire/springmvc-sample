<h3>Angular Restaurant Application</h3>


<div>
	<p>
		This demonstration illustrates using <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular</a>
		for a client side editing application. It is a port of the backbone version in this
		web application</p>
	</p>
	<p>One noticeable difference in this application is that the
		communication between the regions of the code, list, edit and review
		areas, is via a message bus, rather than $scope.watch, emit or
		broadcast. This way, components do not have to be tied to the DOM
		hierarchy to allow for scope communication.</p>

		<code>BackboneRestaurantRestController</code>
