<h3>Get Post Demo</h3>
<div>
This code demonstrates that Controller annotations can be used to control access to the
controlling code, so that a given control function can only be called via get or post.
This can be used to limit calling a function to POST only. For example, this can be used
to limit an email function to only POSTS as a security measure.
