            <h2>Exploring a cancel form</h2>
            <p>This form will have a cancel button that submits the form
             but bypasses validation. The idea is that all validators are contingent
             on what button is pressed. This means a complex form will require
             individual validations.</p>
            <p>Also, the default validator that will not let 'fred' in for an
                integer in the backing bean will have to be bypassed by creating
                an holder that has all strings,which could be validated down
                stream</p>
